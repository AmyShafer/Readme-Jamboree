## Technologies

This application was built using Node, Inquirer, and JavaScript.

The video walk-through was created using Zoom.

## Installation Instructions

To start, type "node index.js" into the Terminal window.

## Possible-improvements

Various areas of the Readme could be edited to be closer to real-life Readme files. For instance, modifying the "Test" section of the markdown to detail tests a user would like to communicate. I think using lists might be visually helpful.

The video walk-through audio and video isn't ideal. I will try Screencastify next time instead of Zoom. Also, you can't really hear the oldie music playing in the background. I choose it to go with the theme of the demo Readme file but I think that might have negatively affected the overall audio quality.
